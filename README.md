# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project implements a classic game of Rock Paper Scissors using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple interface for users to play against the computer. The game keeps track of the user's score (wins, losses, and ties) using local storage, allowing users to see their performance over multiple sessions.

Features
Interactive interface with clickable buttons for user input.
Responsive design for seamless gameplay across devices.
Score tracking to monitor the user's performance.
Reset functionality to clear the score and start anew.
Randomized computer moves for dynamic gameplay.
Usage
To play the game, simply click on one of the three buttons representing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will randomly select its move, and the result will be displayed on the screen along with the updated score. To reset the score and start over, click the "Reset Score" button.

Installation
No installation is required to play the game. Simply open the index.html file in your web browser to begin playing.
